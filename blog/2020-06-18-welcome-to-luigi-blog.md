The new blog section of our website will help you stay on top of the latest AppLaunchpad news and updates.
<!-- Excerpt -->

The AppLaunchpad project is growing quickly and attracting more attention in the open-source community. Micro frontend architecture is becoming more popular as an efficient strategy for future-proof, scalable applications. New features are added to AppLaunchpad regularly, and we want to keep you up to date.

This is why we are adding a blog to our website to inform you of the latest AppLaunchpad releases, updates, and other important news! You can expect regular posts in the future documenting every release and other AppLaunchpad-related topics. If you have an idea for a blog post, you can write to aleksandra.simeonova@sap.com.

And yes, our first blog post is just to let you know that we have a blog now. #meta #nerdy
